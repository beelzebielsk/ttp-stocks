App ideas

- Do more than just display color. Color tells you how the stock is
  doing now relative to earlier in the day. That's a little shallow.
  Show a graph of the stocks. Could be from the start of the day. Look
  for a graphing library. Maybe D3?
- Show how much the stock price has changed relative to the start of
  the day.
- Make sure to explain what the indicators are. Maybe with a little ?
  hover thing. Figure out how to handle that on a phone.
- Maybe learn how package management would work first. Do that for a
  day. You never did sit down with webpack for very long.
- See if you can get stock data from the past. This way you can make a
  time-machine line feature, let the user buy+sell stocks and see if
  they can make a little $. Like a game.
    - Skip ahead to another day
    - Make time run faster
    - Put an on-screen clock which states the current time. How
      smoothly could this animate? How much power will this sap? After
      creating a basic vers of the app, try creating a millisecond
      clock.

- Start off with a desktop version, one that works on your desktop.
  Then try to make it work for mobile.

This could be part of creating an account. What do you want? It could
guide which stocks are shown. Though try to fake this rather than
really do it. You don't know that much about stocks.

Look at a few of these for a few companies. See if it would be
complicated to direct users toward these for some companies. If too
complicated, don't do it.
